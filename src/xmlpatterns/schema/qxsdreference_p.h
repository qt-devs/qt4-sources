     * @short A helper class for element and group reference resolving.
     *
     * For easy resolving of element and group references, we have this class
     * that can be used as a place holder for the real element or group
     * object it is referring to.
     * So whenever the parser detects an element or group reference, it creates
     * a XsdReference and returns it instead of the XsdElement or XsdModelGroup.
     * During a later phase, the resolver will look for all XsdReferences
     * in the schema and will replace them with their referring XsdElement or
     * XsdModelGroup objects.

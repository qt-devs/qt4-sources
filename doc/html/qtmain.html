<p>qtmain is a helper library that enables the developer to write a cross-platform main() function on Windows and on the Symbian platform. If you do not use <a href="qmake-manual.html#qmake">qmake</a> or other build tools such as CMake, then you need to link against the <tt>qtmain</tt> library.</p>

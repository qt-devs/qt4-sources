<p>The Rogue example shows how to use the Qt state machine for event handling.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/rogue-example.png" /></p><p>This example implements a simple text based game. Do you see the <tt>@</tt> in the screenshot? That's you, the rogue. The <tt>#</tt> characters are walls, and the dots represent floor. In a real game, other ASCII characters would represent all kinds of objects and creatures, for instance, ancient dragons (<tt>D</tt>s) or food rations (<tt>%</tt>s). But let's not get carried away. In this game, the rogue is simply running around in an empty room.</p>
<p>The rogue is moved with the keypad (2, 4, 8, 6). That aside, we have implemented a <tt>quit</tt> command that triggers if the player types <tt>q</tt>. The player is then asked if he/she really wants to quit.</p>
<p>Most games have commands that need more than one key press (we think of consecutive presses, i.e&#x2e;, not of several keys being pressed at the same time). In this game, only the <tt>quit</tt> command falls under this category, but for the sake of argument, let's imagine a fully-fledged game with a rich set of commands. If we were to implement these by catching key events in <a href="qwidget.html#keyPressEvent">keyPressEvent()</a>, we would have to keep a lot of class member variables to track the sequence of keys already typed (or find some other way of deducing the current state of a command). This can easily lead to spaghetti, which is--as we all well know, I'm sure--unpleasant. With a state machine, on the other hand, separate states can wait for a single key press, and that makes our lives a lot simpler.</p>
<p>The example consists of two classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>Window</tt> draws the text display of the game and sets up the state machine. The window also has a status bar above the area in which the rouge moves.</li>
<li><tt>MovementTransition</tt> is a transition that carries out a single move of the rogue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we embark on a code walkthrough, it is necessary to take a closer look at the design of the machine. Here is a state chart that shows what we want to achieve:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/rogue-statechart.png" /></p><p>The input state waits for a key press to start a new command. When receiving a key it recognizes, it transitions to one of the two commands of the game; though, as we will see, movement is handled by the transition itself. The quit state waits for the player to answer yes or no (by typing <tt>y</tt> or <tt>n</tt>) when asked whether he/she really wants to quit the game.</p>
<p>The chart demonstrates how we use one state to wait for a single key press. The press received may trigger one of the transitions connected to the state.</p>

<h2>Window Class Definition</h2>
<p>The <tt>Window</tt> class is a widget that draws the text display of the game. It also sets up the state machine, i.e&#x2e;, creates and connects the states in the machine. It is the key events from this widget that are used by the machine.</p>
<pre> class Window : public QWidget
 {
     Q_OBJECT
     Q_PROPERTY(QString status READ status WRITE setStatus)

 public:
     enum Direction { Up, Down, Left, Right };

     Window();

     void movePlayer(Direction direction);
     void setStatus(const QString &amp;status);
     QString status() const;

     QSize sizeHint() const;

 protected:
     void paintEvent(QPaintEvent *event);</pre>
<p><tt>Direction</tt> specifies the direction in which the rogue is to move. We use this in <tt>movePlayer()</tt>, which moves the rogue and repaints the window. The game has a status line above the area in which the rogue moves. The <tt>status</tt> property contains the text of this line. We use a property because the <a href="qstate.html">QState</a> class allows setting any Qt <a href="properties.html">property</a> when entered. More on this later.</p>
<pre> private:
     void buildMachine();
     void setupMap();

     QChar map[WIDTH][HEIGHT];
     int pX, pY;

     QStateMachine *machine;
     QString myStatus;
 };</pre>
<p>The <tt>map</tt> is an array with the characters that are currently displayed. We set up the array in <tt>setupMap()</tt>, and update it when the rogue is moved. <tt>pX</tt> and <tt>pY</tt> is the current position of the rogue. <tt>WIDTH</tt> and <tt>HEIGHT</tt> are macros specifying the dimensions of the map.</p>
<p>The <tt>paintEvent()</tt> function is left out of this walkthrough. We also do not discuss other code that does not concern the state machine (the <tt>setupMap()</tt>, <tt>status()</tt>, <tt>setStatus()</tt>, <tt>movePlayer()</tt>, and <tt>sizeHint()</tt> functions). If you wish to take a look at the code, click on the link for the <tt>window.cpp</tt> file at the top of this page.</p>
<a name="window-class-implementation"></a>
<h2>Window Class Implementation</h2>
<p>Here is the constructor of <tt>Window</tt>:</p>
<pre> Window::Window()
 {
     pX = 5;
     pY = 5;
     ...
     setupMap();
     buildMachine();
 }</pre>
<p>The player starts off at position (5, 5). We then set up the map and statemachine. Let's proceed with the <tt>buildMachine()</tt> function:</p>
<pre> void Window::buildMachine()
 {
     machine = new QStateMachine;

     QState *inputState = new QState(machine);
     inputState-&gt;assignProperty(this, &quot;status&quot;, &quot;Move the rogue with 2, 4, 6, and 8&quot;);

     MovementTransition *transition = new MovementTransition(this);
     inputState-&gt;addTransition(transition);</pre>
<p>We enter <tt>inputState</tt> when the machine is started and from the <tt>quitState</tt> if the user wants to continue playing. We then set the status to a helpful reminder of how to play the game.</p>
<p>First, the <tt>Movement</tt> transition is added to the input state. This will enable the rogue to be moved with the keypad. Notice that we don't set a target state for the movement transition. This will cause the transition to be triggered (and the <a href="qabstracttransition.html#onTransition">onTransition()</a> function to be invoked), but the machine will not leave the <tt>inputState</tt>. If we had set <tt>inputState</tt> as the target state, we would first have left and then entered the <tt>inputState</tt> again.</p>
<pre>     QState *quitState = new QState(machine);
     quitState-&gt;assignProperty(this, &quot;status&quot;, &quot;Really quit(y/n)?&quot;);

     QKeyEventTransition *yesTransition = new
         QKeyEventTransition(this, QEvent::KeyPress, Qt::Key_Y);
     yesTransition-&gt;setTargetState(new QFinalState(machine));
     quitState-&gt;addTransition(yesTransition);

     QKeyEventTransition *noTransition =
         new QKeyEventTransition(this, QEvent::KeyPress, Qt::Key_N);
     noTransition-&gt;setTargetState(inputState);
     quitState-&gt;addTransition(noTransition);</pre>
<p>When we enter <tt>quitState</tt>, we update the status bar of the window.</p>
<p><tt>QKeyEventTransition</tt> is a utility class that removes the hassle of implementing transitions for <a href="qkeyevent.html">QKeyEvent</a>s. We simply need to specify the key on which the transition should trigger and the target state of the transition.</p>
<pre>     QKeyEventTransition *quitTransition =
         new QKeyEventTransition(this, QEvent::KeyPress, Qt::Key_Q);
     quitTransition-&gt;setTargetState(quitState);
     inputState-&gt;addTransition(quitTransition);</pre>
<p>The transition from <tt>inputState</tt> allows triggering the quit state when the player types <tt>q</tt>.</p>
<pre>     machine-&gt;setInitialState(inputState);

     connect(machine, SIGNAL(finished()), qApp, SLOT(quit()));

     machine-&gt;start();
 }</pre>
<p>The machine is set up, so it's time to start it.</p>
<a name="the-movementtransition-class"></a>
<h2>The MovementTransition Class</h2>
<p><tt>MovementTransition</tt> is triggered when the player request the rogue to be moved (by typing 2, 4, 6, or 8) when the machine is in the <tt>inputState</tt>.</p>
<pre> class MovementTransition : public QEventTransition
 {
     Q_OBJECT

 public:
     MovementTransition(Window *window) :
         QEventTransition(window, QEvent::KeyPress) {
         this-&gt;window = window;
     }</pre>
<p>In the constructor, we tell <a href="qeventtransition.html">QEventTransition</a> to only send <a href="qevent.html#Type-enum">KeyPress</a> events to the <a href="qabstracttransition.html#eventTest">eventTest()</a> function:</p>
<pre> protected:
     bool eventTest(QEvent *event) {
         if (event-&gt;type() == QEvent::StateMachineWrapped &amp;&amp;
             static_cast&lt;QStateMachine::WrappedEvent *&gt;(event)-&gt;event()-&gt;type() == QEvent::KeyPress) {
             QEvent *wrappedEvent = static_cast&lt;QStateMachine::WrappedEvent *&gt;(event)-&gt;event();

             QKeyEvent *keyEvent = static_cast&lt;QKeyEvent *&gt;(wrappedEvent);
             int key = keyEvent-&gt;key();

             return key == Qt::Key_2 || key == Qt::Key_8 || key == Qt::Key_6 ||
                    key == Qt::Key_4;
         }
         return false;
     }</pre>
<p>The KeyPress events come wrapped in <a href="qstatemachine-wrappedevent.html">QStateMachine::WrappedEvent</a>s. <tt>event</tt> must be confirmed to be a wrapped event because Qt uses other events internally. After that, it is simply a matter of checking which key has been pressed.</p>
<p>Let's move on to the <tt>onTransition()</tt> function:</p>
<pre>     void onTransition(QEvent *event) {
         QKeyEvent *keyEvent = static_cast&lt;QKeyEvent *&gt;(
             static_cast&lt;QStateMachine::WrappedEvent *&gt;(event)-&gt;event());

         int key = keyEvent-&gt;key();
         switch (key) {
             case Qt::Key_4:
                 window-&gt;movePlayer(Window::Left);
                 break;
             case Qt::Key_8:
                 window-&gt;movePlayer(Window::Up);
                 break;
             case Qt::Key_6:
                 window-&gt;movePlayer(Window::Right);
                 break;
             case Qt::Key_2:
                 window-&gt;movePlayer(Window::Down);
                 break;
             default:
                 ;
         }
     }</pre>
<p>When <tt>onTransition()</tt> is invoked, we know that we have a <a href="qevent.html#Type-enum">KeyPress</a> event with 2, 4, 6, or 8, i.e&#x2e;, the event is already unwrapped.</p>
<a name="the-roguelike-tradition"></a>
<h2>The Roguelike Tradition</h2>
<p>You might have been wondering why the game features a rogue. Well, these kinds of text based dungeon exploration games date back to a game called, yes, &quot;Rogue&quot;. Although outflanked by the technology of modern 3D computer games, roguelikes have a solid community of hard-core, devoted followers.</p>
<p>Playing these games can be surprisingly addictive (despite the lack of graphics). Angband, the perhaps most well-known rougelike, is found here: <a href="http://rephial.org/">http://rephial.org/</a>.</p>
